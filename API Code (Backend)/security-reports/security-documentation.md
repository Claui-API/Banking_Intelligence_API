Hosting Strategy
Our organization uses AWS Cloud-based infrastructure for hosting server-side components:

Production Environment:

AWS EC2 instances running in us-east-2 region
RDS PostgreSQL for database storage
SQLite for development and testing environments
Automatic backups enabled for data protection


Server Configuration:

Linux-based EC2 instances (as shown in network discovery)
Node.js application server
Express.js web framework
PM2 process manager for application reliability


Redundancy and Scaling:

Multi-availability zone deployment
Auto-scaling capabilities for handling traffic fluctuations
Load balancing for request distribution



Information Security Policy
Our organization has implemented a comprehensive information security policy that includes:

Authentication Framework:

JWT token-based authentication with configurable lifetimes

Access tokens: 1 hour
Refresh tokens: 7 days
API tokens: 30 days


Two-factor authentication with TOTP and backup codes


Access Control:

Role-based access control with distinct user/admin permissions
Client status management workflow (pending, active, suspended, revoked)
API usage quotas and rate limiting


Security Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging system using Winston
Authentication event tracking
Security scanning workflow automation
Regular vulnerability assessment


Secure Development:

Code security reviews
Dependency vulnerability tracking
Automated security testing



Network Endpoint Management
We maintain visibility into all network endpoints through our automated asset discovery system:

Asset Discovery Process:

Automated network endpoint detection (as shown in scan results)
Regular inventory maintenance and updates
Identification of all connected devices and instances


Current Inventory Status:

Total assets: 2 (as shown in scan results)
Active assets: 2
Asset classifications by type (workstation: 2)
Inventory stored in structured format for tracking


Monitoring:

Continuous monitoring of connected endpoints
Alerts for unauthorized devices
Health status tracking of all endpoints



Vulnerability Scanning
Regular vulnerability scans are performed against all endpoints:

Scanning Methodology:

NPM dependency scanning for application vulnerabilities
OWASP Dependency Check for third-party component vulnerabilities
Docker image scanning (when applicable)
Server endpoint scanning


Scan Frequency:

Weekly scans of production environments
On-demand scans after major dependency updates
Continuous monitoring using automated tools


Latest Scan Results (from scan output):

Total vulnerabilities: 5
Critical: 0
High: 3
Medium: 1
Low: 1
Status: 5 open/in remediation


Remediation Process:

Critical vulnerabilities: 24-hour remediation
High vulnerabilities: 7-day remediation
Medium/Low vulnerabilities: Prioritized in backlog
Verification rescans after remediation



Endpoint Security
All endpoints are protected against malicious code through:

Security Assessment Results (from scan output):

Endpoint issues found: 2

No antivirus software detected (high priority)
Disk encryption is not enabled (medium priority)




Remediation Plan:

Implementation of antivirus/anti-malware solution
Enabling LUKS disk encryption on Linux servers
System update enforcement
Regular security compliance checking


Security Control Status:

System updates: Up to date (per scan)
Security patches: Applied promptly
Endpoint monitoring: Active



BYOD Policy
Our BYOD policy for employee devices includes:

Security Requirements:

Mandatory device enrollment in MDM
Required security software installation
Encryption enforcement
Secure authentication setup


Access Controls:

Two-factor authentication for all corporate resource access
Automatic compliance verification before access
VPN requirement for remote access
Limited access based on device security status


Data Protection:

Corporate data containerization
Remote wipe capability for corporate data
Data loss prevention controls
Separation of personal and corporate data


Compliance Verification:

Regular security compliance checks
Automatic security posture assessment
Remediation guidance for non-compliant devices
Temporary access restrictions for non-compliant devices



Access Control Process
We have implemented comprehensive access controls for production assets as shown in our security scan:

Authentication Framework:

JWT token-based authentication
Client credential management
Role-based permissions
API session management


Access Control Components (from scan output):

Auth middleware components: 3

authMiddleware - For general authentication
apiTokenMiddleware - For API token validation
authorize - Role-based access control




Database Access Controls (from scan output):

Database control mechanisms: 4
User model with role-based permissions
Client model with status controls
Token management and validation
Secure connection handling


Access Workflow:

New client registration with pending status
Admin approval requirement
Automatic usage tracking
Quota enforcement
Token expiration and renewal



Strong Authentication
We have deployed strong authentication for critical assets:

Two-Factor Authentication:

Successfully implemented 2FA system (confirmed in security scan)
TOTP-based authentication
Backup codes for recovery
Database schema supports 2FA fields


Implementation Details (from scan output):

User model integration: Completed
2FA service: Implemented
Auth service integration: Completed
Auth controller methods: Implemented
Auth routes: Configured


Authentication Workflow:

Initial login with username/password
2FA verification requirement
Token generation after successful 2FA
Secure 2FA secret storage
Client status verification


Token Security:

Server-side token validation
Short-lived access tokens
Refresh token rotation
Token revocation capabilities
