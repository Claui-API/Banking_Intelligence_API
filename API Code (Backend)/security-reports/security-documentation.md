## Information Security Policy

Our organization has implemented a comprehensive information security policy that includes:

- Authentication and access control with JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for segregation of duties
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) for critical assets
- Regular vulnerability scanning and remediation
- Endpoint security validation
- Network asset discovery and management
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Network Endpoint Management

We maintain visibility into all network endpoints through:

- Automated network asset discovery scans
- Asset inventory maintenance
- AWS resource discovery for cloud assets
- Local network scanning for on-premises resources

## Vulnerability Scanning

Regular vulnerability scans are performed against all endpoints:

- Dependency scanning via NPM audit and OWASP Dependency Check
- Docker image scanning for container vulnerabilities
- Network endpoint vulnerability scanning

Latest scan identified 5 vulnerabilities:
- Critical: 0
- High: 3
- Medium: 1
- Low: 1

## Endpoint Security

All endpoints are protected against malicious code through:

- Antivirus/anti-malware software
- Host-based firewalls
- System update enforcement
- Disk encryption

Endpoint security status:
- Total endpoints: 1
- Fully secured: 0
- With security issues: 2

## BYOD Policy

Our BYOD policy for employee devices includes:

- Required security measures (antivirus, firewall, encryption)
- Two-factor authentication requirement
- Regular security compliance checking
- Remote wipe capability for lost/stolen devices
- Acceptable use policies

## Access Control Process

We have implemented comprehensive access controls for production assets:

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT token-based authentication
- Client credential management with approval workflow
- API usage quotas and rate limiting
- Token expiration and refresh policies

Access control audit results:
- API routes with auth: 0
- Admin routes with explicit checks: 0
- Auth middleware components: 3
- Database access controls: 4

## Strong Authentication

We have deployed strong authentication for critical assets:

- Two-factor authentication (2FA) using TOTP
- Backup codes for 2FA recovery
- JWT token-based API authentication
- Password strength requirements
- Account status verification
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
